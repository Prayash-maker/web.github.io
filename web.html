You know,<br> my friends, with what a brave carouse I <br>made a Second Marriage in my house;<br> favored old barren reason from my bed,<br> and took the daughter of the vine to spouse.<br>  The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts<br> upon Turns Ashes - or it prospers; and<br> anon, Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty<br> Face, Lighting a little hour or two - is gone.
